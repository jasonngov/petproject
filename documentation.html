                <p>Game 7. This was the biggest game of LeBron James' career. He led the Lakers from a 3-0 comeback against Kevin Durant and the Warriors. 
                   Going into the half, the Warriors led by a large margin of fifteen points. LeBron needed a miracle and prayed to the basketball gods. Out of nowhere, a golden drink appeared beside him.
                   Without much hesitation, LeBron grabs the cup and chugs every drop of the golden elixr. His head begins to swirl and his body begins to rock back and forth, in a blink of an eye, LeBron finds himself 
                   in someones basement. He is now pet to a deranged fan. Although LeBron James is a great pet to have, his demands require a trainer with a discipline and mental fortitude fit for a King. Regarded as one of the greatest
                   athletes of all time, LeBron does not take being a pet lightly. For starters, he does not like being called a pet. He is nicknamed the King of Basketball and should be treated like one. 
                   Any type of petting or yelling will anger LeBron and will decrease his happiness and health. Over time, his hungriness will gradually decrease. If the King is not fed in time, both his happiness 
                   and health will decrease. The only way to increase his happiness level is by complementing or feeding the King. The King expects nothing less.

                    <p> 
                        The user interface was designed using Bootstrap's CSS library. In terms of writing the logic, I created multiple arrays that stored the image, moods, and 
                        responses for LeBron. For each button I created a function that updated the values that corresponded to each action. If LeBron was pet, then the button would call the pet() function
                        and decrease the happiness of LeBron. In addition, I implemented a setInterval() function that decreased LeBron's hungriness over time. For every 2-3 seconds, his hungriness would decrease by 
                        5. When his hungriness level would pass 75, his happinessLevel would decrease, and when either his happinessLevel or hungrinessLevel would go below 50, his health would decrease. For my generated
                        thoughts and images, I used Math.random() as my index, and parsed through each of my respective arrays. The only challenge was writing the logic to update and keep track of
                        the statistics when each button was pressed.
